Added games:

- Biomechanical Toy
  Added company name: ZEUS (games\games.c, games\games.h)
  Notes: sound is added and it works but you have to wait a few seconds at startup for sound
  banks to be decoded. If the game is run in DOS Raine crashes if sound is enabled : is it a
  M6295 bank decoding bug ?
  

- Gunbird, Sengoku Ace
  Added company name: Psikyo (games\games.c, games\games.h)
  There is nosound and there is a gfx glitch in Gunbird in the train stage because 
  sprites are not drawn in order. To support this:
  added in video\scroll.h: 512_2048_2_16
  video\palette.c: void Map_15bit_xRGB_Rev_68k(int bank, int cols);

There is no sound in Gunbird and Sengoku Ace: can someone add it ? 
All the informations are in the MAME source (thanks to Luca Elia who wrote the driver) :-). 
I tried adding it but there are two things I can't figure out: 1) when I add Z80 , the M68020
doesn't start 2) how can I add a read function for  the 68020 ? 

directory bonus: gunbird with correct sprite order and slow!, gunbird with incomplete and 
non working sound
