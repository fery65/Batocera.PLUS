20-11 :
 - gunbird.c : fast bankswitch with a pointer instead of a memcpy
 - fm.c : make sure v value passed to YM2610Write is in the good range.

19-11 :
 - alsound : added the dump channel option for debugging the sound in
   dfeveron. The dumping works, but I could not debug that sound yet !!!
 - mz280.* : new mame z280 support (cave games)
 - cave.c : added sound for all games. Added mame eprom support. Added
   preliminary support for ddonpach, but video does not work (yet) !!!
 - gunbird.c : added btlkrodj, thanks go to mame's driver author for his help! 
   changing though.
 - mame/* : added eprom support. Changed whole structure to allow including of
   only the handlers (for sound).

12-11-2001 :

 - Succeeded to push antiriad to add his touch to the code !!!
 - Started a preliminary compatibility layer with mame. See gunbird.c for
   the first steps. For now not much is done, and it creates warnings, but
   it works !
 - Added 16/24/32 bpp compat to warriorb
 - readded sengoku ace. The sound does not work and I don't know why for now.
 - s/DEADBEEF/0xDEADBEEF/ in the new asm routines. It broke compilation on
  linux.
